Project title: Bindr (rhymes with Tinder)

Problem statement:
 - General-level: many people do not know how to properly sort their trash
 - Game-level: the player is given unsorted items to be handled correctly within a time
   constraint

How do you solve the problem?
- General-level: teaches people how to sort their trash
- Game-level: the player sorts each item by selecting its correct bin (compost, landfill, paper, 
  or glass/metal/plastic)
	- The player is given 30 seconds to sort through as many items as possible
	- Items are sorted by dragging them into bins
	- 1 point is awarded for each item correctly sorted
	- 1 point is deducted for an incorrectly sorted item

Features:
- Pop-up window before the start of each game that displays fun facts about recycling 
- Sorting Game
- Website design (front-end framework)
- Bin animation (Javascript framework)
- Leaderboards for all-time top 10 scores (server-side data persistence) and personal best scores
  (client-side data persistence) with charts and graphs

Data:
- Nickname of player
- Score

Algorithms:
- No

Electronic mockups: as included in folder

* I was balking at the fact that "many people do not know how to properly sort their trash."  However, looking at the screenshots, I see you are referring to recycleable trash --and yes, that's true people don't know what goes to what.
* No server-side storage makes this project very manageable.
* I would like you to add a wrinkle to the game to make it even more challenging or perhaps more valuable: hazardous wastes including batteries!  The labs would LOVE that.
