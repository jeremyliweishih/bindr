#Project title: Bindr (rhymes with Tinder)
- Built with Phaser, Node, Express, and MongoDB

#Problem statement:
 - General-level: many people do not know how to properly sort their trash
 - Game-level: the player is given unsorted items to be handled correctly within a time
   constraint

#How do you solve the problem?
- General-level: teaches people how to sort their trash
- Game-level: the player sorts each item by selecting its correct bin (compost, landfill, paper, 
  or glass/metal/plastic)
	- The player is given 30 seconds to sort through as many items as possible
	- Items are sorted clicking bins
	- 1 point is awarded for each item correctly sorted
	- 1 point is deducted for an incorrectly sorted item
